    <p>Doesn't theat Eggplant Unagi look delicious!?!? Ever since I went vegan, I have been missing classic Japanese dishes that I grew up loving. 
        One of the dishes was unagi. I thought I'd never be able to have it again. You can imagine my surprise and delight when I found out people 
        have been replacing the eel with eggplant to make a vegan variant, and let me tell you, it is DELICIOUS! Let's break down this recipe y'all!
